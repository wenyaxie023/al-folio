I’m **Wenya Xie**, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the **University of Minnesota (UMN)**, advised by [**Prof. Zirui Liu**](https://zirui-ray-liu.github.io/). Previously, I worked as a research assistant at CUHK (Shenzhen) with Benyou Wang and Feng Jiang. I received my bachelor’s degree from Wuhan University.

My research centers on **large language models**, with a particular focus on **agent memory** and **multi-turn interaction**.

Currently, I’m exploring:

• Memory modeling & evaluation (exact recall, aggregation, drift).
• Learning from user feedback expressed in natural language to adapt to personalized preferences.

I’m always excited to connect. Questions, ideas, and early-stage thoughts are all welcome.
